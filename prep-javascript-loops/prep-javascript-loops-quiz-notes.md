## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of the **condition** expression in the `for` and `while` loops?

The condition expression determines whether the loop will continue running. The loop executes as long as this condition evaluates to true

- When is the first expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **initialization**) evaluated?

The initialization expression is evaluated once, right before the loop starts.

- When is the second expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **condition**) evaluated?

The condition expression is evaluated before each iteration of the loop. If it evaluates to false, the loop stops.

- When is the third expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **final expression**) evaluated?

The final expression is evaluated after each iteration of the loop, just before the condition is checked again.

- What is the purpose of the **final expression** in a `for` loop?

The final expression typically updates the loop's counter or variable, preparing it for the next iteration.

- What types of data should the `for...in` loop be used on?

should be used on objects to iterate over their keys.
